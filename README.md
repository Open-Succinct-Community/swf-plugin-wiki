Succinct Wiki Plugin

This is a plugin to the Succinct Web Frameork. This enables any succinct application that depends on this plugin to have a wiki of its own. 

This plugin provides the Page model, where a mark down document can be stored.
It renders the markdown document using the [pegdown](http://www.pegdown.org) 

The documents are lucene indexed and therefore can be searched easily.
